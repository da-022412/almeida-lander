                    could possibly play out, to the patience of answering all
                    your questions in between. I didn't feel like a client he
                    served, but a friend he took care of. I'll never forget how

                    in a lengthy Qui Tam case with FDA and DOJ. J.R. Parker was
                    instrumental in this process. During this extraordinarily
                    long case, that was delayed due to COVID, there was never an
                    instance where I didn’t feel supported or cared for by J.R.
                    and his team. His accessibility, communication, compassion,
                    and knowledge were critical in the success of my case as
                    well as my sanity. I would recommend J.R. Parker
                    enthusiastically to anyone who needs an attorney who will
                    look out for you, protect you and be there when needed.”

                    fired from my job. I felt hopeless and unsure of how to move
                    forward. When I started looking for an attorney, I had no
                    idea what to expect. After a little research I found Mr.
                    Khosrowshahi. He took the time to hear my story and answer
                    all the questions I had. He was a friendly and informational
                    ally throughout my entire case and made sure I knew
                    everything going on every step of the way. When he took my
                    case, it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders and
                    that I had found the right person to fight for me. If you’re
                    searching for an attorney to help you, then look no further.
                    Mr. Khosrowshahi is the knowledgeable and fierce lawyer you

                    through stormy seas, but with J.R. Parker at the helm, I
                    found smooth waters. From our very first consultation, it

                    Throughout the process, his expertise shone brightly as he

                    employer, I had the privilege of working closely with Ash
                    Khosrowshahi the entire process. From our initial
                    consultation, it was evident that Ash Khosrowshahi possessed
                    an in-depth knowledge of employment law and a genuine
                    dedication to advocating for his clients. He patiently
                    listened to my concerns, thoroughly analyzed the details of
                    my case, and provided me with clear and informed guidance on
                    the best course of action. Throughout the lawsuit, Ash
                    Khosrowshahi consistently demonstrated his expertise and
                    professionalism. He gathered evidence, conducted extensive
                    research, and skillfully presented our arguments in court.
                    His strong negotiation skills and strategic approach
                    resulted in a favorable outcome for me, and I am immensely
                    grateful for his legal representation. What truly set Ash
                    Khosrowshahi apart was his unwavering commitment to my case.
                    He provided regular updates, promptly responded to my
                    inquiries, and consistently reassured me throughout the
                    process. His compassionate and empathetic nature made me
                    feel supported and valued as a client. I felt as if it was
                    truly his passion and not a job. I would highly recommend
                    Ash Khosrowshahi to anyone seeking legal representation in
                    employment law matters. His exceptional legal expertise,
                    professionalism, and dedication to my case makes him an
                    outstanding choice. I am sincerely grateful for his services

                    efficient, and personable in all matters and has the highest

                    expert when it came to the facts of the case and the law.
                    Ash fought for me when it seemed like the world was crashing
